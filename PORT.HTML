    <h1>MY SCIENCE PROJECT- RAIN WATER HARVESTING</h1>
    <P>Rainwater Harvesting is one of the most commonly used methods to save water. It refers to storing of rainwater for various uses. The notion behind rainwater harvesting is to not waste the rainwater and prevent it from running off. In other words, it is done to collect rainwater using simple mechanisms. This method is very useful considering the water scarcity that is happening in India. Moreover, rainwater harvesting is so easy that almost anyone can do it. We must encourage this practice to help people get access to clean water easily without any cost.</P>
